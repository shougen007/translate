## Giving feedback

이 프로세스의 중요한 부분은 모든 단계에서 피드백을 받고 이에 응답하는 것입니다. 이를 용이하게 하기 위해 저에게 피드백을 줄 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법은 다음과 같습니다:

What should you give feedback on? The structure of the book/chapter, whether something was unclear, ideas or suggestions for how I could improve it, new ideas you think I should consider... I'm open to everything related to the content.

*Please don't* give feedback on spelling and grammar. That'll all be sorted out during the proofreading later.
